## Christian Perrine

### Description
##### This code begins with a large CSV containing a variety of information regarding country's top 200 music charts over the past several years, including the song title, artist, position on the chart, country, and total streams at the time. Then, using a csv reader the large csv is broken into 3 separate files, one for Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Using pymysql, the data is then imported into MySQL and stored within a table that can be queried by the user.
